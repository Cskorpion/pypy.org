PyPy has had many [financial contributors](categories/sponsors.html) in the
past. We are grateful to them, and to the following current sponsors:

- [Baroque Software](https://baroquesoftware.com) who hosts the [buildbot
  master](https://buildbot.pypy.org) as well as our [benchmark
  runner](https://speed.pypy.org/about/)

- The recurring fiscal sponsors via
  [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/pypy).

- Others providing buildbot workers
