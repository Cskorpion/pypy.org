We provide pre-compiled binaries for many platforms and OSes. There are also
pre-compiled binaries available on `conda-forge`_. We have found conda-forge
a convenient and cooperative community for distributing not only the
interpreter, but many packages like SciPy that are difficult to build and 
which do not yet have binary PyPy builds available on PyPI.

.. note::
  Our `nightly binary builds`_ have the most recent bugfixes and performance
  improvements, though they can be less stable than the official releases. See
  these links for `other versions`_ or `more information`_ including other
  platforms.
