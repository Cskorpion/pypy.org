Following the example of many other FOSS projects, the PyPy team has
decided to move its official ``#pypy`` IRC channel from Freenode to
[Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/): [irc.libera.chat/pypy](irc://irc.libera.chat/pypy)

The core devs will no longer be present on the Freenode channel, so we recommend to
join the new channel as soon as possible.

wikimedia.org has a
[nice guide](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Migrating_to_Libera_Chat) on
how to setup your client to migrate from Freenode to Libera.Chat.
