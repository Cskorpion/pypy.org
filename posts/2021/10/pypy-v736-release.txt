=====================================================
PyPy v7.3.6: release of python 2.7, 3.7, and 3.8-beta
=====================================================

The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.6 of PyPy, which includes
three different interpreters:

  - PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the ``+`` is for
    backported security updates)

  - PyPy3.7,  which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 3.7, including the stdlib for CPython 3.7.12.

  - PyPy3.8, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 3.8, including the stdlib for CPython 3.8.12. Since this is our
    first release of the interpreter, we relate to this as "beta" quality. We
    welcome testing of this version, if you discover incompatibilites, please
    report them so we can gain confidence in the version.

The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. Highlights of the release, since the release of 7.3.5 in May 2021,
include:

  - We have merged a backend for HPy_, the better C-API interface. The backend
    implements HPy version 0.0.3.
  - Translation of PyPy into a binary, known to be slow, is now about 40%
    faster. On a modern machine, PyPy3.8 can translate in about 20 minutes.
  - PyPy Windows 64 is now available on conda-forge_, along with nearly 700
    commonly used binary packages. This new offering joins the more than 1000
    conda packages for PyPy on Linux and macOS. Many thanks to the conda-forge
    maintainers for pushing this forward over the past 18 months.
  - Speed improvements were made to ``io``, ``sum``, ``_ssl`` and more. These
    were done in response to user feedback.
  - The 3.8 version of the release contains a beta-quality improvement to the
    JIT to better support `compiling huge Python functions`_ by breaking them
    up into smaller pieces.
  - The release of Python3.8 required a concerted effort. We were greatly
    helped by @isidentical (Batuhan Taskaya) and other new contributors.
  - The 3.8 package now uses the same layout as CPython, and many of the
    PyPy-specific changes to ``sysconfig``, ``distutils.sysconfig``, and
    ``distutils.commands.install.py`` have been removed. The ``stdlib`` now
    is located in ``<base>/lib/pypy3.8`` on ``posix`` systems, and in
    ``<base>/Lib`` on Windows. The include files on windows remain the same.
    On ``posix`` they are in ``<base>/include/pypy3.8``. Note we still use the
    ``pypy`` prefix to prevent mixing the files with CPython (which uses
    ``python``.

We recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.6 releases here:

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear about
it and encourage submissions to our blog_ via a pull request
to https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org

We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: `PyPy`_
and `RPython`_ documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on PyPy, or general `help`_ with making RPython's JIT even better. Since the
previous release, we have accepted contributions from 7 new contributors,
thanks for pitching in, and welcome to the project!

If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a CFFI_ / cppyy_ version of your library that would be performant on PyPy.
In any case both `cibuildwheel`_ and the `multibuild system`_ support
building wheels for PyPy.

What is PyPy?
=============

PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.7, and
soon 3.8. It's fast (`PyPy and CPython 3.7.4`_ performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.

We also welcome developers of other `dynamic languages`_ to see what RPython
can do for them.

This PyPy release supports:

  * **x86** machines on most common operating systems
    (Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 64 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)

  * big- and little-endian variants of **PPC64** running Linux,

  * **s390x** running Linux

  * 64-bit **ARM** machines running Linux.

PyPy does support Windows 32-bit and ARM 32 bit processors, but does not
release binaries. Please reach out to us if you wish to sponsor releases for
those platforms.
