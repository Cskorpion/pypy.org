===================================================
PyPy v7.3.12: release of python 2.7, 3.9, and 3.10.
===================================================

The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.12 of PyPy. 
This release includes a new string-to-int algorithm (also appearing in CPython
3.12) that is faster than the older one; support for symlinks in Windows; and
our first Python3.10 version.

The release includes three different interpreters:

  - PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the ``+`` is for
    backported security updates)

  - PyPy3.9, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 3.9, including the stdlib for CPython 3.9.17.

  - PyPy3.10, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 3.10, including the stdlib for CPython 3.10.12. This is our first
    release of 3.10, but based on past experience we are quite confident in
    its compatibility with upstream. Of course, we recommend testing your code
    with this new version before putting it into production. Note it does
    require at least cython 0.29.35 or cython 3.0.0b3

The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. It follows after 7.3.11 release on Dec 29, 2022

We recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.12 releases here:

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
`direct consulting`_ work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear about
it and encourage submissions to our blog_ via a pull request
to https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org

We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: bug fixes,
`PyPy`_ and `RPython`_ documentation improvements, or general `help`_ with making
RPython's JIT even better. Since the previous release, we have accepted
contributions from one new contributor, thanks for pitching in, and welcome
to the project!

If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a HPy_ / CFFI_ / cppyy_ version of your library that would be performant
on PyPy. In any case, both `cibuildwheel`_ and the `multibuild system`_ support
building wheels for PyPy.

What is PyPy?
=============

PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.9 and
3.10. It's fast (`PyPy and CPython 3.7.4`_ performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.

We also welcome developers of other `dynamic languages`_ to see what RPython
can do for them.

We provide binary builds for:

  * **x86** machines on most common operating systems
    (Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS 64 bits, Windows 64 bits)

  * 64-bit **ARM** machines running Linux (``aarch64``).

  * Apple **M1 arm64** machines (``macos_arm64``). 

  * **s390x** running Linux

PyPy support Windows 32-bit, Linux PPC64 big- and little-endian, and Linux ARM
32 bit, but does not release binaries. Please reach out to us if you wish to
sponsor binary releases for those platforms. Downstream packagers provide
binary builds for debian, Fedora, conda, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Gentoo, and more.
