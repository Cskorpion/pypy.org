What is a sprint?
------------------

The experience of the PyPy project has shown the benefits of regular
sprints. They are focussed one week physical meetings where people pair-program
on new features and discuss future plans. Coming to one is a great way to get
started with a project!

Location
--------

The sprint will take place in a seminar room of the computer science
department.  It is in the building 25.12, room 02.50 (second floor) of the
university campus. For travel instructions see

We ask participants to wear masks during the indoor working hours.
