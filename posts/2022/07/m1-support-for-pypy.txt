The PyPy team is happy to announce that we can now target the macOSX ARM64
platform. Much of the work was executed by Maciej Fija≈Çkowski (fijal) and
funded via a generous contribution to our OpenCollective_. The work is based
on our existing support for ``aarch64`` (arm64 on linux) with some twists to
support the differences between the CPUs and the operating system. There
are nightly builds for pypy3.8_ and pypy3.9_ (look for ``macosx_arm64``), and
the architecture will be part of our next release.

Please try it out and let us know how it is useful for you or how we could
improve.

We still need help improving our macOSX support. We have an `open issue`_ to
help our packaging story. Help is welcome.
