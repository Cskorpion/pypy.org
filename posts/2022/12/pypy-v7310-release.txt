=================================================
PyPy v7.3.10: release of python 2.7, 3.8, and 3.9
=================================================

The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.10 of PyPy. We have some nice
speedups and bugfixes we wish to share. The release includes three different
interpreters:

  - PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the ``+`` is for
    backported security updates)

  - PyPy3.8, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 3.8, including the stdlib for CPython 3.8.15.

  - PyPy3.9, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 3.9, including the stdlib for CPython 3.9.15. We have gained
    confidence in the stability of this version, and are removing the "beta"
    label.

The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. Highlights of the release, since the release of 7.3.9 in March 2022
include:

  - A release of Apple Silicon M1 arm64 versions. This work `was sponsored`_ by
    an anonymous donor and is tested on our buildbots.

  - Many improvements to the basic interpreter to make it 15-20% faster

  - The conda-forge community `has built`_ over 1000 packages for PyPy3.8 and 3.9,
    making it easier than ever to use PyPy.

  - Update the packaged OpenSSL to 1.1.1s, sqlite3 to 3.39.4, and apply
    applicable security fixes from CPython 3.9.15 to PyPy2.7

  - Update the HPy_ backend in PyPy3.8 and PyPy3.9 to 0.0.4

We recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.10 releases here:

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
`direct consulting`_ work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear about
it and encourage submissions to our blog_ via a pull request
to https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org

We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: bug fixes,
`PyPy`_ and `RPython`_ documentation improvements, or general `help`_ with making
RPython's JIT even better. Since the previous release, we have accepted
contributions from five new contributors, thanks for pitching in, and welcome
to the project!

If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a HPy_ / CFFI_ / cppyy_ version of your library that would be performant
on PyPy.
In any case, both `cibuildwheel`_ and the `multibuild system`_ support
building wheels for PyPy.

What is PyPy?
=============

PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.8 and
3.9. It's fast (`PyPy and CPython 3.7.4`_ performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.

We also welcome developers of other `dynamic languages`_ to see what RPython
can do for them.

We provide binary builds for:

  * **x86** machines on most common operating systems
    (Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS 64 bits, Windows 64 bits)

  * 64-bit **ARM** machines running Linux (``aarch64``).

  * Apple **M1 arm64** machines (``macos_arm64``). 

  * **s390x** running Linux

PyPy support Windows 32-bit, Linux PPC64 big- and little-endian, and Linux ARM
32 bit, but does not release binaries. Please reach out to us if you wish to
sponsor binary releases for those platforms. Downstream packagers provide
binary builds for debian, Fedora, conda, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Gentoo, and more.
