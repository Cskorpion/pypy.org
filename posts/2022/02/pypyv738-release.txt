PyPy v7.3.8: release of python 2.7, 3.7, and 3.8-beta
=====================================================

The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.8 of PyPy. It has been only a few
months since our last release, but we have some nice speedups and bugfixes we
wish to share. The release includes four different interpreters:

  - PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the ``+`` is for
    backported security updates)

  - PyPy3.7,  which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 3.7, including the stdlib for CPython 3.7.12. This will be the last
    release of PyPy3.7.

  - PyPy3.8, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 3.8, including the stdlib for CPython 3.8.12. This is our third
    release of this interpreter, and we are removing the "beta" tag.

  - PyPy3.9, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
    Python 3.9, including the stdlib for CPython 3.9.10. As this is our first
    release of this interpreter, we relate to this as "beta" quality. We
    welcome testing of this version, if you discover incompatibilities, please
    report them so we can gain confidence in the version. 

The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. Highlights of the release, since the release of 7.3.7 in late October 2021,
include:

  - PyPy3.9 uses an RPython version of the PEG parser which brought with it a
    cleanup of the lexer and parser in general
  - Fixed a regression in PyPy3.8 when JITting empty list comprehensions
  - Tweaked some issues around changing the file layout after packaging to make
    the on-disk layout of PyPy3.8 more compatible with CPython. This requires
    ``setuptools>=58.1.0``
  - RPython now allows the target executable to have a ``.`` in its name, so
    PyPy3.9 will produce a ``pypy3.9-c`` and ``libpypy3.9-c.so``. Changing the
    name of the shared object to be version-specific (it used to be
    ``libpypy3-c.so``) will allow it to live alongside other versions.
  - Building PyPy3.9+ accepts a ``--platlibdir`` argument like CPython.
  - Improvement in ssl's use of CFFI buffers to speed up ``recv`` and ``recvinto``
  - Update the packaged OpenSSL to 1.1.1m

We recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.8 releases here:

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear about
it and encourage submissions to our blog_ via a pull request
to https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org

We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: `PyPy`_
and `RPython`_ documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on PyPy, or general `help`_ with making RPython's JIT even better. Since the
previous release, we have accepted contributions from 6 new contributors,
thanks for pitching in, and welcome to the project!

If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a HPy_ / CFFI_ / cppyy_ version of your library that would be performant
on PyPy.
In any case both `cibuildwheel`_ and the `multibuild system`_ support
building wheels for PyPy.

What is PyPy?
=============

PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.7, 3.8 and
3.9. It's fast (`PyPy and CPython 3.7.4`_ performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.

We also welcome developers of other `dynamic languages`_ to see what RPython
can do for them.

This PyPy release supports:

  * **x86** machines on most common operating systems
    (Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 64 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)

  * 64-bit **ARM** machines running Linux. A shoutout to Huawei for sponsoring
    the VM running the tests.

  * **s390x** running Linux

  * big- and little-endian variants of **PPC64** running Linux,

PyPy support Windows 32-bit, PPC64 big- and little-endian, and ARM 32 bit, but
does not release binaries. Please reach out to us if you wish to sponsor
releases for those platforms.

Known Issues with PyPy3.9
=========================

- There is still a known `speed regression`_ around ``**kwargs`` handling
- We slightly modified the concurrent future's ``ProcessExcecutorPool`` to
  start all the worker processes when the first task is received (like on
  Python3.8) to avoid an apparent race condition when using ``fork`` and
  threads (issue 3650_).


What else is new?
=================

Please update, and continue to help us make PyPy better.

Cheers,
The PyPy team
